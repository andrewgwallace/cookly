Cookly
===

What started as a in-class exercise is being expanded upon for the sole purpose of developing a tutorial on on development best practices.  If you've been looking for sample exercises to do in Rails 4.1 then this will hopefully serve as a great learning tool.  

- NOTE:  This is being actively developed and is the "test bed" for the development of a tutorial which will later be made.  It should never be considered "final" but is rather just a resource for the curious of you.  First and foremost it serves to keep me motivated in practicing my skills, then my interest in helping others.

What is covered:
---
* Agile Development
* Setting up a new rails app
* Creating a database
* Creating the models
* Relating models
* Installing relevant gems
* PostgreSQL
* Devise
* Pry
* RSpec
* Deployment to Heroku (or maybe ninefold? TBD)
* The Rails Console
* Working with Views (HTML, ERB, CSS)

Procedural Documentation
---

As I work through building out this application, I keep documentation going that has notes, advice, tips, and the step-by-step procedure.  If you'd like to check it out for yourself you can view it here at the link below.  It will be used as the foundation for creating the script for what will hopefully be some screencast tutorials.   If not, it should at least well enough on its own to get you going.
